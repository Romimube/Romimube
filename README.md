## Hi! My name is Romina 👋🏻

<!--
**Romimube/Romimube** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a passionate programmer with a strong emphasis on software development and continuous learning. 
I began my journey at Facultad de Ingeniería (Fing), where I built a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics. A year and a half ago, I transitioned to Universidad ORT to pursue my passion for technology, where I continue to expand my skills in programming and system development.

💻 Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in languages like Haskell, Python, JavaScript, and C++, while exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity.  
🌐 I'm also skilled in web development using HTML, CSS, and React, and I have experience with database management in MySQL.
🎯 DevOps practices, including Git, Docker, are areas I’m actively working on to streamline software development processes.
